			"As a physics student at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH), I am passionate about exploring various disciplines within the STEM realm and understanding the inner workings of various phenomena. I am pursuing my bachelor's degree in physics, which challenges me to learn new concepts and skills every day. I am also proficient in Python, a programming language that is widely used in physics and other STEM fields. I have applied my Python skills to various projects and assignments, such as simulating physical systems, analyzing data, and creating visualizations. I am eager to further improve my Python skills and learn other relevant tools and technologies that can enhance my research and learning outcomes.In addition, I have gained valuable experience as a sales assistant at 7-Eleven, where I provide customer service, handle transactions, and manage inventory. This has enhanced my communication, problem-solving, and teamwork skills, as well as my work ethic and adaptability. My motivation stems from a desire to contribute meaningfully to the STEM community and make a positive impact while gaining valuable experience that propels my growth. I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge, hone my skills, and connect with like-minded professionals."
